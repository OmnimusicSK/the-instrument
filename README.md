### guide on how to deploy on github pages

    - if hosting on github,
    - i.e., 
    - USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME
    - https://zeukterialpneumaion.github.io/the-instrument/

-------

Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

----

Run the following commands to initialize a git repository in your Vite app and push your existing code to a remote repository on GitHub.

- $ git init
- $ git add .
- $ git commit -m "initial-commit"
- $ git branch -M main
- $ git remote add origin http://github.com/{username}/{repo-name}.git
- $ git push -u origin main
  
  ---

Step 2: Update vite.config.js

---

- Add the base URL in this file by setting the base as ‚Äú/{repo-name}/‚Äù. 
- For example, if your repository‚Äôs name is book-landing-page then set the base like this:

    import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

 ```
    // https://vitejs.dev/config/
    export default defineConfig({
        plugins: [react()],
        base: "/book-landing-page/"
    })

 ```

---
Step 3: Install gh-pages

---

- Install gh-pages package as a dev dependency.

- npm install gh-pages --save-dev

- Step 4: Update package.json

- Update package.json with the following predeploy and deploy scripts.

 ```

"scripts": {
    "predeploy" : "npm run build",
    "deploy" : "gh-pages -d dist",
    ...
}

 ```


- Add the complete website URL by setting homepage in package.json

- "homepage": "https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}/"

- Thus, your updated package.json will look like this:

 ```
{
  "name": "book-product",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "homepage": "https://aishwaryaparab.github.io/book-landing-page/",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy" : "npm run build",
    "deploy" : "gh-pages -d dist",
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    ...
}

 ```

---
Step 5: Run Deploy
---
- If you‚Äôve made it till here, you‚Äôre almost there. Run the final command:

- npm run deploy

- And you‚Äôre done!

---
add this to vite.config.js
---

 ```

export default {
  base: '/<REPO_NAME>/'
}

 ```
